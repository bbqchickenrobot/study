Chapter 1   Introduction

-   Limits of Machine Learning

    1)  While humans have a vast amount of cultural knowledge and 
        experience to draw upon, as well as remarkable ability to 
        recognize similar situations when making decisions about 
        new information, ML methods can only generalize based on 
        the data that has already been seen, and even then in a very 
        limited manner.

    2)  All machine-learning methods suffer from the the possibility of
        overgeneralizing. As with most things in life, strong 
        generalizations based on a few examples are rarely entirely
        accurate. E.g.

        You may receive an email from a friend that contains message 
        "online pharmacy".

Chapter 2   Recommendation system

-   Collaborative Filtering

    A collaborative filtering algorithm usually works by searching a large
    group of people and finding a smaller set with tastes similar to yours.
    It looks at other things they like and combines them to create a ranked
    list of suggestions.

-   Euclidean Distance Score

    1)  Score two users' similarities.

    2)  for each item, do: 

    sum_of_squares=sum([pow(prefs[person1][item]-prefs[person2][item],2)
    for item in prefs[person1] if item in prefs[person2]])

    3)  return 1 + sqrt(sum_of_squares)

-   Pearson Correlation Score

    The correlation coefficient is a measure of how well two sets of data fit on a straight line.
    Comparing to Euclidean Distance Score, it tends to give better resutls in situations
    where the data isn't well normalized - e.g. if critics' movies rankings are
    routinely more harsh than average.
